The extension uses the Extension Manager to detect errors by preparing the extension for loading into memory.  The session must be restarted because you cannot patch code while it is executing.  There are no provisions in the shell code to be re-mapped for patching. Wayland sessions require a logout and login to complete the reload from disk to memory.  Xorg sessions can be restarted Alt F3 r.",
