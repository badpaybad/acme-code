  "description": "This extension is intended for extension writers.  The extension has been changed so any installed extension can be reloaded.  The extension's panel button indicates when the current session is Wayland.  When an extension is reloaded the current session must be restarted to load the changes into memory (unless the extension changes from the ERROR state to the ENABLED state).  If the current session is an Xorg session the Alt F2 r sequence can be used to perform the restart.  If the extension is in the DISABLED state it is enabled before the reload.  Please see the extension website for additonal details.",
